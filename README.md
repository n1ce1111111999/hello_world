# hello_world
It's the early days, therefore
first things should be first. Family! 

I will start with coding a SolanaPay Application to be used by my aunt & uncle. 
They run a restaurant, and they worked very hard, for not much.
They overpayed massively for building their restaurant and paid a really high interest rate for a long time, not paying off much of their debt. 

Thats why I want to help them. 

Thanks to pointer_gg for the tutorial! 

And without further ado. 

Lets get cooking!
